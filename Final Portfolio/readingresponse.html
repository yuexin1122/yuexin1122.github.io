        WEEK2: Mail Art and the Big Monster from Second Thoughts
        <p>
            This article focuses on mail art and discusses its current situation, dilemma, and how we should position it in the art field. The author believes that although the postal system mediates mail art, its artistry mainly lies in the artist's creation, rather than the act of mailing itself.
            Among them, the author compares the postal system to the big monster, because the postal system's restriction on the size of mail is a challenge for artists to create.
            To put it in a nutshell, the author tries to define the meaning of mail art, which was popular in the 1960s and 1970s and emphasizes the difficulties and challenges encountered in its creation, as well as the role of the artist in it.
        </p>
        Question: If a piece of mail art can't be sent through the real postal system, can it still be prefixed with mail?
            Is mail art a manifestation of the decentralization and de-elite of art? Is it related to some kind of art trend after World War II?

        WEEK3: Creative Independent and Arena How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully
        </p>
        In the first article, Laurel explores the poetic potential of the Internet and personal websites. She reflects on the evolution of the Internet from a tool to a place we inhabit, emphasizing the importance of individual creativity in shaping online spaces. She compares websites to rooms, bookshelves, and gardens, suggesting that they are not only functional spaces but also expressions of personal identity. According to Laurel, websites provide an opportunity for artists and individuals to take back the web from large corporations and create meaningful, personalized worlds. She argues that websites should be compared as a dynamic, evolving space(a flork of birds) and creators should think of their websites as living organisms that evolve over time, much like how a garden grows.

In the second one, Édouard discusses the process of creating a personal knowledge network. He reflects on how information is interconnected and how making personal connections between ideas can foster deeper understanding. Édouard challenges traditional linear learning methods and encourages a more networked approach to learning. 

 He also emphasizes the importance of creating “personal abstractions”, which are personal interpretations and connections between different forms of knowledge. These individual networks allow for a more flexible and adaptable way of learning, rather than the rigid structures usually imposed by formal education or traditional forms of media.

Both articles emphasize the importance of restoring individual agency in a digital world increasingly dominated by large corporations and linear modes of thinking. Édouard's metaphorical exploration of websites and Édouard U's focus on personal networks of knowledge imply that individuals should control their digital presence and learning processes.
        <p>
            Question: As mentioned in the first article, domain names, and website maintenance all cost money. For individuals, especially individual artists, how can they get enough money to make enhancements to their website while avoiding the dilemma of placing ads on the user experience?
        </p>
        WEEK4: STILL THERE Ruins and Templates of Geocities from Lost and Living (in) Archives
        <p>
            Lialina discusses how Geocities, in its heyday, provided individuals with the tools to create personal websites, leading to the birth of what we might call the "amateur web." The content was often unpolished, chaotic, and deeply personal. Yet, these sites were a crucial form of digital self-expression in the early days of the web. Through her analysis of the archived pages, she explores the aesthetics of Geocities, with its bordered backgrounds, rudimentary graphics, and animated GIFs that have since become symbols of early web culture. These elements, once considered the pinnacle of web design, are now relics of a bygone era, reminding us of the fast-paced evolution of the internet.

            Lialina’s work highlights a key issue in the preservation of digital culture. The erasure of Geocities by Yahoo! in 2009 was a significant loss, much like the demolition of a historic building. However, the “rescue” of Geocities pages by the Archive Team offers a form of digital preservation that allows researchers to access and analyze these web "ruins." In this sense, preserving Geocities is akin to restoring a heritage site — we may not be able to interact with it as we once did, but we can still appreciate its cultural and historical value. 
        </p>
        Question: Is there any means for the public to get access to these past sites? It's a pity when I tried to click the link in the article but found nothing :(

            WEEK5: A *New* Program for Graphic Design
        </p>
        In this week’s reading, David Reinfurt presents a thought-provoking intersection between Gestalt theory and contemporary digital design. One key takeaway is how he bridges traditional design principles with the ever-evolving field of digital interfaces. I found Reinfurt’s explanation of how we naturally perceive whole objects rather than individual components particularly engaging, as it aligns with the way we experience digital interfaces today—designers must work with the user's innate desire for simplicity and coherence. 

What stood out most to me was Reinfurt’s emphasis on user-friendly interfaces, something I had always noticed but never fully connected to the underlying principles of Gestalt psychology. We often take for granted the practical application of concepts like proximity and similarity in organizing visual information online. His connection between these principles and modern technology makes me question how often designers consciously incorporate these techniques in today’s digital products, or whether it has become an intuitive part of design practice.
        <p>
            Question: How do these ideas translate when designers are constrained by clients’ or companies’ demands, particularly when commercial goals limit artistic freedom? Is it possible to always balance creativity and functionality, or do designers sometimes have to sacrifice one for the other? 
        </p>
        WEEK6: Publishing from Post-Digital-Print
        <p>
            In this week's reading, the author explores the shifting relationship between print and digital media, emphasizing that the transition from analog to digital is not linear but fluid. He argues that while digital media has transformed how we access and share information, print retains a unique value due to its tactile and cultural significance. This is especially evident in contemporary DIY publishing and zine cultures, where print is viewed as a collectible object and a medium for social exchange outside the control of major digital platforms.

The author raises an interesting point about how print, unlike music or video, is both a carrier and the display medium itself, meaning that transitioning to digital dramatically alters the user experience. He suggests that while digital publishing offers superior networking capabilities, it lacks the physical qualities that make print engaging and valuable. He also highlights the potential for hybrid models that combine the best of both worlds, such as using QR codes in printed books to provide updates or integrating personal printing solutions for customized content.
        </p>
        Question: How can the publishing industry create more meaningful hybrid models that maintain the cultural value of print while utilizing the networking advantages of digital media?
        <p>
            WEEK8: Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook
        </p>
        The Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook presents an engaging and creative approach to thinking about accessibility on the web. The author challenge readers to reconsider alt-text, a technical aspect of web accessibility, as a form of poetry. One of the key takeaways from the workbook is the emphasis on attention to language. Alt-text requires careful word choice to convey the essence of an image in a concise way. This concept of “word economy” is particularly interesting because it aligns with how poetry distills language to its most potent form, while still being expressive. This is vital in alt-text because descriptions need to be brief yet impactful, providing enough detail for a user who cannot see the image but without overwhelming them with too much information. I also found the idea of treating alt-text as a form of translation fascinating. Just like translation between languages, writing alt-text involves transforming visual information into a different medium—text. This transformation is never perfect, and some information is inevitably lost. However, the process of creating alt-text also adds new layers of meaning. The subjective choices made in selecting what details to include and how to structure them highlight the creative and interpretive nature of this practice.
        <p>
            Questions: How do the needs for Alt-Text vary across different cultural or linguistic contexts?
        </p>
        WEEK9: "A Personal Computer for Children of All Cultures" from Decolonising the Digital
        <p>
            The article explores the cultural and linguistic biases present in programming languages and technology, particularly the heavy reliance on English. The author highlights how projects like One Laptop Per Child, while aiming to empower children through education, inadvertently exclude non-English speakers due to the English-based technology frameworks they rely on. This made me realize that modern programming languages and technology are not truly "global" or "decentralized."

Also, Nasser's own attempt to create an Arabic programming language underscores the deep-seated linguistic bias, revealing that programming is not just a technical process, but also a cultural and linguistic one. The article makes me reflect on the cultural impact of technological development and how we can better balance linguistic diversity with the spread of technology. It shows that even though technology may seem neutral, the design and implementation can create significant inequalities for people from different cultural backgrounds.
        </p>
        Question: As a student whose first language is not English, I do encounter some difficulties that other native speaker might not face during coding. I wonder creating a language (culture) 's own programming system wouuld actually eliminate cultural differences or create a bigger one because of language barrier.
        <p>
            WEEK10: New Modernism(s)
        </p>
        The text explores how the treatment of signs and surfaces differs across Modernism, Postmodernism, and Hypermodernism in graphic design. In modernism, the relationship between the surface and signifier is "one-to-one," with a strict standardization of symbols and surfaces. Postmodernism introduced ambiguity, reflecting the instability of meanings in design. Hypermodernism, however, uses the ever-expanding surface of the internet to link signs to numerous associations and layers, forming a new kind of design symbol system. This made me reflect on how contemporary graphic design in a virtual space uses hyperlinking to create richer layers of meaning and user interaction.

Another insightful part was the discussion on the evolving concept of "surface," particularly in the digital age. Duvall highlighted that the surface is no longer just physical materials like paper or cloth; it now includes infinitely extending virtual surfaces composed of pixels. Designers must recognize the unique nature of these virtual surfaces and understand how they can carry and communicate signs in new ways. This made me realize that contemporary design is about arranging symbols and shaping layered interactions and experiences through new media.
        <p>
            Questions: In Hypermodernism, signs are presented through networks and hyperlinks, creating multiple layers of meaning. Does this imply that designers are losing some control over the message, allowing the audience's interpretation to dominate? How can designers balance control over their intended message while encouraging free interpretation in this "hyperlinked" system?
        </p> 
        WEEK12: Beyond the New Media Frame The Poetics of Absence in Vera Frenkel’s String Games
        <p>
            In this week's reading, Dot Tuer discusses how artist Vera Frenkel used early video technology in a piece called String Games to explore ideas of memory, connection, and distance. The work is a teleconferencing performance from 1974 in which people in different cities pretend to pass an invisible string between each other over video. This simple act turns into something powerful, showing how technology can bring people together while still keeping them apart.

What I found interesting was how Frenkel uses “absence” to make the performance more meaningful. Even though people are “together” through the screen, they can’t actually touch or fully connect, which adds a layer of loss to the experience. It reminded me of how we often feel when using technology to stay in touch—like video calls, which make us feel close but also highlight the fact that we’re not really there with each other.
        </p>
        Question: In what ways could the sense of “absence” that we feel in digital spaces actually help us create new forms of connection?
        <p>
            WEEK13: Performing the Feed
        </p> 
        In this week's reading, what impressed with me most is his observation that feeds demand a new kind of attention, one that is reactive and immersed in "new boredom," where we consume information in a constant flow, often without reflection. This made me reflect on how we engage with digital platforms daily, sometimes scrolling endlessly without a clear purpose. He challenges us to rethink publishing not as a break in the flow of information, but as a layered, evolving presence that merges the digital and physical worlds.

A particularly thought-provoking point is Soulellis’s call to resist the "smooth flow" of feeds by interrupting them through acts like printing, archiving, or redistributing content. This resistance feels vital in a time when algorithms often shape what we see, limiting critical engagement.
        <p>
            Question:
How can we design digital tools or platforms that encourage users to pause, reflect, and critically engage with information, rather than simply consuming it as part of an endless feed?
        </p>
        WEEK14: Beyond Dark Matter from Logic Issue 15 Beacons
        <p>
            The story uses a fictional narrative to explore the relationship between humans and technology. Through Gem's journey, we see how she interacts with "The Way," a software system that seems powerful but ultimately oppressive. The story raises important questions about how technology influences our lives, often in ways we don’t fully understand. By contrasting "The Way" with "The Beyond," the author highlights the potential for community, memory, and human relationships to act as alternatives to technological control.

What stood out to me was how the story connects the history of technology, like the master/slave relationship in computing, to larger societal systems of oppression. This made me think about how the tools we use today are built on specific historical and cultural frameworks, which can sometimes reinforce inequalities. The narrative also made me reflect on my relationship with technology and whether it truly empowers or limits me in daily life.
        </p> 
        Question: How can we design technology that prioritizes community-building and human agency over control and efficiency?
        <p>
        WEEK15: Art on the Internet
        </p>
        In this week's reading, one point that stood out to me was Groys' discussion on how the Internet de-fictionalizes art. Unlike traditional institutions that frame art in a curated, almost sacred way, the Internet makes art just one piece of data among millions. This made me think about how easily art can become lost in the digital world unless it’s actively sought out or algorithmically promoted. Groys also highlights how the Internet’s transparency challenges the traditional creative process, as artists no longer work in private but are subject to constant visibility and surveillance.

        This reading made me reflect on the balance between accessibility and value. On one hand, the Internet democratizes art by giving everyone a platform. On the other hand, it can dilute the impact of art by overwhelming it with endless information. It raises questions about how we, as viewers, determine what is meaningful in a digital space where everything is equally accessible.
        <p>
            Question: How can artists maintain the integrity and significance of their work in an Internet-driven world where art is often reduced to just another piece of content?
