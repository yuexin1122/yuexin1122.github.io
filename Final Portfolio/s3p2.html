            In this project, we explored APIs, which enable applications, tools, or services to securely "share" restricted data with one another. We were tasked with designing and implementing an interactive tool that utilizes API integration with IFTTT and creating a website to promote this IFTTT functionality.
                <p>Me and my teammates design an IFTT: Every time a new photo is added to your album, itâ€™s automatically uploaded to your Google Drive account, freeing up valuable iCloud space effortlessly.
